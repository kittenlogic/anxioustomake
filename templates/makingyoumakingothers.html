        <p><em>Making You</em> is a promotional marketing video, durational performance, market research study, and entry point for unpacking the neoliberal subject.</p>

        <p>The project targets a new generation of artist-entrepreneurs and precarious workers, delivering an experience that makes taking the first step towards understanding, resisting and/or embodying this new creative archetype easy and fun.</p> 

        <h1 class="title">Description</h1>  
        <p>These days, everyone wants to be a brand. An entrepreneur. A “self-made” individual. But where does this desire come from?</p>

        <p>Neoliberalism, as a biopolitical project, tells us that as individuals, we must remake ourselves in the image of the market economy; that our ability to relate to others transactionally is at the heart of what it means to be human; and that the entrepreneur is the archetype for the type of human being we should all strive to become.</p>

        <p>As these ideas continue to be shaped and amplified by increasingly precarious economic conditions, this project asks:</p>

        <p>1. How is a self made?<br/>
        2. What kinds of subjectivities are being produced by the sharing economy?<br/>
        3. What does artistic practice like look as we move into this new economy and phase of global capitalism where the social­-political subject turned “entrepreneur of the self” is now being augmented into a “portfolio manager of the self”?</p>
