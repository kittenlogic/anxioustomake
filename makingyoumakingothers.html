  <meta name='description' content='Making You, Making Others is a promotional video / performance collaboration between an algorithm, a pair of artists, and a gig-­economy-­spokesperson­-for-­hire. It is part of an ongoing series about the sharing economy by Liat Berdugo and Emily Martinez, that asks: What kinds of subjectivities are produced by the sharing economy– and how do these ideas relate to a subject re/produced in vulnerability, self­-appreciation and self-­esteem, qualities that underlie the psychology of the neoliberal subject? What does artistic practice look like as we move into this new economy and phase of global capitalism where the social­-political subject turned "entrepreneur of the self" is now being augmented into a "portfolio manager of the self"? Finally, how can we use the sharing economy as a resource for developing new forms of critical art practice– as a space for performance, production, collaboration or resistance?'>

      <p><strong>Anxious to Make</strong> is the collaborative practice of Liat Berdugo and Emily Martinez, two commissioning bodies. Our focus is on the so-called "sharing economy" and the contemporary artists "anxiety to make" in the accelerationist, neoliberal economic landscape. While Anxious to Make’s physical existence takes many shifting forms, it often manifests as series of video commissions, downloads, online generators, workshops, net art interventions, and sweepstakes. Anxious to Make believes in absurdist extremes as way to examine contemporary realities. Our work has appeared recently in EMMEDIA (Calgary, CA), Transmediale (Berlin, DE), Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (San Francisco), MoMA PS1 (New York), V2_ Institute for the Unstable Media (Rotterdam, NL), and The Luminary (St. Louis, MO).</p>

        <p>Making You, Making Others is a promotional video / performance collaboration between an algorithm, a pair of artists, and a gig-­economy-­spokesperson­-for-­hire. It is part of an ongoing series about the sharing economy that asks: What kinds of subjectivities are produced by the sharing economy, and how do these ideas relate to a subject re/produced in vulnerability, self­-appreciation and self-­esteem, qualities that underlie the psychology of the neoliberal subject? What does artistic practice look like as we move into this new economy and phase of global capitalism where the social­-political subject turned "entrepreneur of the self" is now being augmented into a "portfolio manager of the self"? Finally, how can we use the sharing economy as a resource for developing new forms of critical art practice – as a space for performance, production, collaboration or resistance?</p>
