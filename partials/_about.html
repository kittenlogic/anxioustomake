      <p><strong>Anxious to Make</strong> is the collaborative practice of Liat Berdugo and Emily Martinez, two commissioning bodies. Our focus is on the so-called "sharing economy" and the contemporary artists "anxiety to make" in the accelerationist, neoliberal economic landscape. While Anxious to Makeâ€™s physical existence takes many shifting forms, it often manifests as series of video commissions, downloads, online generators, workshops, net art interventions, and sweepstakes. Anxious to Make believes in absurdist extremes as way to examine contemporary realities. Our work has appeared recently in EMMEDIA (Calgary, CA), Transmediale (Berlin, DE), Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (San Francisco), MoMA PS1 (New York), V2_ Institute for the Unstable Media (Rotterdam, NL), and The Luminary (St. Louis, MO).</p>
