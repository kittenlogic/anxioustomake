      <p><strong>Anxious to Make</strong> is the collaborative practice of <strong>Liat Berdugo</strong> and <strong>Emily Martinez</strong>, two commissioning bodies.<br/><br/>Our focus is on economic concepts, such as cryptocurrencies and the so-called “sharing economy”, and the accelerationist, neoliberal landscapes associated with them.<br/><br/>Our work examines how these economic concepts intersect with colonialism, technology, wealth culture, race, altruism, utopianism, and exploitation.<br/><br/>While Anxious to Make’s physical existence takes many shifting forms, it often manifests as series of video commissions, downloads, online generators, workshops, net art interventions, books, and sweepstakes.<br/><br/>Anxious to Make believes in absurdist extremes as way to examine contemporary realities.<br/><br/>Our work has appeared recently in Drugo More (Rijeka, Croatia), EMMEDIA (Calgary, CA), Transmediale (Berlin, DE), Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (San Francisco), MoMA PS1 (New York), V2_Lab for the Unstable Media (Rotterdam, NL), The Luminary (St. Louis), The Institute of Network Cultures (Amsterdam, NL), The Wrong Biennale, and Telematic (San Francisco).</p>
